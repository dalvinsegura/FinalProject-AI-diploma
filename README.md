# Final Project - AI Diploma
Overview
This project is the final capstone of an Artificial Intelligence Diploma, applying machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and optimize business decision-making. It consists of two main components:

1. Customer Churn Prediction - A supervised learning model that predicts customer attrition based on historical data.
2. Mall Customer Segmentation - An unsupervised learning approach that groups shoppers into different segments based on spending habits and demographics.

### Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Models (Classification & Clustering)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Objectives
âœ… Demonstrate AI knowledge gained during the diploma program
âœ… Apply machine learning models to real-world business scenarios
âœ… Develop predictive analytics and customer segmentation strategies

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files).
3. Run the cells to train and evaluate the models.
